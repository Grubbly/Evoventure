# Evoventure
An adventure game based on [Evoland](http://www.evoland2.com/) that implements topics learned in an introductory graphics course.

## Premise
You are a renderer in a world that constantly changes appearance. Throughout your various quests and explorations, you will discover new graphical enhancements that will expand where and what you can do in the game. The world is extensive, but your rendering capabilities are not. In the beginning you will be limited to the number of graphical enhancements that can be active at a time. The combinations you choose will affect how you can interact with the environment.
